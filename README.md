#Deauth attack
A Wi-Fi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point.

#Beacon attack
This attack scenario concerns the connectivity confusion of a wireless client. We are going to transmit countless fake beacon frames.

#Probe attack
A probe is an attack which is deliberately crafted so that its target detects and reports it with a recognizable “fingerprint”in the report. The attacker then uses the collaborative infrastructure to learn the detec- tor's location and defensive capabilities from this report.
